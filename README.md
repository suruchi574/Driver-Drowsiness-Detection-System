The purpose of the drowsiness detection system is to aid in the prevention of accidents passenger and commercial vehicles. The system will detect the early symptoms of drowsiness before the driver has fully lost all attentiveness and warn the driver that they are no longer capable of operating the vehicle safely. This device will not, however, guarantee that the driver will be fully awakened and that an accident will be avoided. It is simply a tool for improving driver safety; focusing primarily on long-haul truck drivers, nighttime drivers, people driving long distances alone or people suffering from sleep deprivation.
